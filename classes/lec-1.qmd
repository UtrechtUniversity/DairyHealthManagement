# Dairy Health Management

## What is Dairy Health Management

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
> "Dairy health management is a critical aspect of ensuring the well-being and productivity of dairy cattle while maintaining the quality and safety of milk and dairy products. It encompasses a range of practices aimed at preventing, diagnosing, and treating various health issues that can affect dairy animals."
:::

# Course learning goals and philosophy

## Course learning objectives (part 1)

1.  Understand Dairy Animal Physiology
2.  Identify Common Health Issues
3.  Implement Disease Prevention Strategies
4.  Optimize Nutrition and Feeding
5.  Master Reproductive Management

## Course learning objectives (part 2)

1.  Apply Advanced Technologies
2.  Design Cow Comfort and Housing
3.  Practice Effective Milking Protocols
4.  Develop Herd Health Management Plans
5.  Promote Sustainable Dairy Farming

## Topics that will be covered

::: incremental
-   Week 1 - Youngstock management
-   Week 2 - Transition management
-   Week 3 - Reproduction management
-   Week 4 - Infectious disease management
-   Week 5 - Mastitis & claw health management
:::

## Double diamond principle

-   These learning objectives will be activated through weekly iterations of the [double diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)) approach as illustrated for any dairy process in the next slide.

-   The double diamond principle will be used throughout the course, and will hopefully help you to understand more complex future (herd health management) issues you encounter in your future work.

## Course FAQ

::: incremental
-   **What background is assumed for the course?** Definitely the *Sustainable Animal Production Chains* course.
-   **Will we be doing practical things ?** Yes. You will be assigned one farm which will be used throughtout the course. You are assumed to visit this farm regularly.
-   **Will we learn the theory or practical dairy health management?** Hopefully BOTH. The course is mainly intended to build on existing knowledge acquired during the bachelor courses. The theoretical background will be activated with theoretical courses, meet the experts and hands-on labs.

# Course overview

## Homepage

[https://github.com/Bovi-analytics/DairyHealthManagement](https://bovi-analytics.github.io/DairyHealthManagement/)

-   All relevant course materials (and history)
-   Links to Teams, GitHub, Feed'n practice, etc.
-   Let's take a tour!

## Activities: Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform {.smaller}

-   **Prepare:** Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by completing the readings (and sometimes watching the videos)
-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours, herd visits
-   **Practice:** Practice applying dairy health management concepts and nutitional management
-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data
    -   Feed'n practice x 5
    -   Knowledge challenges x 5 (individual)
    -   Farm peer-presentations (teams)
    -   Knowledge exams x 5 (individual)

## Recurring weekly pattern

::: incremental
-   **Knowledge challenge:** Each Monday starts with a knowledge challenge. This is not an official exam but will hopefully challenge on gaps in your current knowledge.
-   **Meet the experts:** Twice a week (Monday and Wednesday afternoon), several experts will cover the week's topic in interactive sessions (to get most out of this, be prepared).
-   **Feed'n practice:** Every Tuesday afternoon, practical labs will be held to increase your dairy nutrition skills.
-   **Peer presentation:** Every Friday, each of the teams will present their farms approach to the management of the topic covered during that week.
-   **Knowledge check:** Friday afternoon, a knowledge check will be held to check your progress in practical and theoretical knowledge from the weeks' topic.
:::

## Teams

-   Team assignments
    -   Assigned by us
    -   Application exercises, labs, and project
    -   Peer evaluation during teamwork and after completion
-   Expectations and roles
    -   Everyone is expected to contribute equal *effort*
    -   Everyone is expected to understand *all* material presented
    -   Individual contribution evaluated by peer evaluation, commits, etc.

## Grading {.smaller}

| Category | Percentage |
|----------|------------|
| TBD      | 100%       |

See [course syllabus](https://sta210-s22.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html) for how your final grade will be determined.

## Support

-   Attend office hours
-   Ask (or even better help answering) questions during the course!!!
-   Reserve email for questions on personal matters
-   Read the [course support](https://sta210-s22.github.io/website/course-support.html) page

## Announcements

-   Posted on [Blackboard](https://uu.blackboard.com/) (Announcements tool) and sent via email, be sure to check both regularly
-   I'll assume that you've read an announcement by the next "business" day

## Diversity + inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

::: incremental
-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!
-   Please let me know your preferred pronouns. You'll also be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by me or anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

# Double Diamond Farms

## Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver

To maximize knowledge activation, a real dairy farm will be put at your team's disposal during this DHM course.

These farms have committed to activally participate:

-   Allow farm visits (max n= TBD) to discover how specific aspects on the farm are managed (eg milking procedure).

-   Share current and historical information on management aspects such as:

    -   Management data

    -   Milk recordings

    -   Nutritition

    -   Genetics

    -   Laboratory results and disease status

## Deliver

At the end of the week, your team is expected to present your farm's approach towards that weeks health topic to your peers using the acquired knowledge.

# Course policies

## Late work, waivers, regrades policy

-   We have policies!
-   Read about them on the [course syllabus](https://sta210-s22.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html) and refer back to them when you need it

## Collaboration policy

-   **Peer presentations** (Fridays) are supposed to be completed collaboratively.

-   **Knowledge challenges** (Mondays) and **Knowledge checks** (Fridays) must be completed individually. You may **not** directly share answers with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

## Sharing / reusing farm information from previous DHM courses

-   We are aware that as this course will take place several times a year, previous teams will have worked on specific health management topics on the farm.

-   Be awere that Dairy Health Management is a continuously changing and dynamic component of herd health.

-   We encourage you to progress on previous insights, copy-pasting will be evaluated accordingly (see [Policies Utrecht University](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/policies-and-procedures/fraud-and-plagiarism)).

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the [Utrecht University Code of Conduct](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/policies-and-procedures/regulations):
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
>
> -   I will act if the Code is compromised.

## Farm data

-   Be aware that

    -   the participating dairy farmers are sharing sometimes sensitive and personal data with you.

    -   you are supposed to use that data for educational purposes only.

    -   your professional conduct is expected.

-   Misuse of the data

    -   will be punished.

    -   influences future participation of the collaborating farms.

## Most importantly!

Ask if you're not sure if something violates a policy!

# Making DHM a success
