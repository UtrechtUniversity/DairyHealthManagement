## Introduction

This lab will go through many different approaches to nutritional transition cow management as an addition to principles explained by the experts. The main goal is to reinforce our understanding of dry and fresh cow nutrition. Particular focus will be on energy, protein and mineral requirements.

## Learning goals

By the end of the lab, you will...

-   Be familiar energy, protein and mineral requirements for dry cows
-   Understand different approaches to dry cow requirements
-   Balance a dry and fresh cow diet using different forages
-   ...

## Getting started

::: callout-important
The lab will use an online feed balancing software. If you are not familiar with the software, make sure to read the Getting Started section.

## Available silages

Below is an overview of different silages available on a farm you consult with.

### Corn silage

## Exercises

Add each of the aforementioned forages to your feed library.

Depending on the geo-spatial area where the dairy farm is situated, typical dry cow diets might differ. The farm manager and the nutritionist ask for your advice formulating different pre-fresh diets. You can add other forages/products (which he eventually has to buy).

Summarize each of the diets according to their energy, protein and mineral content. You can use (but not limited, this example)

| Nutrient            | Diet exercize 1 | Diet exercize 2 | Diet exercize 3 |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Energy              |                 |                 |                 |
| Protein component 1 |                 |                 |                 |
| Protein component 1 |                 |                 |                 |
| Calcium (g/kg DM)   |                 |                 |                 |
| P (g/kg DM)         |                 |                 |                 |
| ...                 |                 |                 |                 |

### Exercise 1 -\> Grass silage based

Formulate a pre-fresh diet in the case the dairy farmer asks you to use as much grass silage as possible as he wants to keep all corn silage for the lactating dairy cows.

The diet should be formulated to meet the requirements for energy, protein and minerals.

::: callout-note
This diet might be typcial for grazing systems such as the North of the Netherlands, Ireland and New Zealand. When formulating such diets, scientific literature from these regions will be more suitable.

### Exercise 2 -\> Corn silage based

Formulate a pre-fresh diet in the case the dairy farmer asks you to use as little grass silage as possible as he wants to keep all grass silage for the lactating dairy cows. You can add other forages/products (which he eventually has to buy).

The diet should be formulated to meet the requirements for energy, protein and minerals.

::: callout-note
This diet is more typcial for non-grazing systems such as France, North America. When formulating such diets, scientific literature from these regions will be more suitable.
:::

### Exercise 3 -\> Strategy cost evaluation

Calculate the total cost per cow day (€/cow/day or \$/cow/day) for the diets from exercise 1 and 2. Provide an overview of the relative contribution of each component in the ration.

::: callout-note
The relative contribution of each component will help to evaluate the cost of each nutritional strategy, with a special focus on prevention of hypocalcaemia.
