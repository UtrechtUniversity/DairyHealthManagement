Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

## Lectures and labs

If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a peer teaching opportunity for everyone.

## Office hours

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments. A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of this resource! Make a pledge to stop by office hours at least once during the first three weeks of class. If you truly have no questions to ask, just stop by and say hi and introduce yourself. You can find a list of everyone's office hours [here](/course-team.html).

## Discussion forum

Have a question that might be valuable for all course participant? Prefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person? The online discussion forum is the best venue for these! We will use [github issue](https://github.com/Bovi-analytics/DairyHealthManagment/issues) as the online discussion forum. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond!

## Email

Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go here [github issue](https://github.com/Bovi-analytics/DairyHealthManagment/issues)), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.). For such matters, you may email Dr. Miel Hostens at [m.m.hostens\@uu.nl](mailto:m.m.hostens@uu.nl).
