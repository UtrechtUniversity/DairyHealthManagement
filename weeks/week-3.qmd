# Introduction

During this week students will focus on reproductive management on dairy farms as the basis for an economically and efficient milk production both on cow and herd level. After a general introduction to adopt and repeat reproductive knowledge special attention will be the Reproductive Management background and policy on dairy farms including data analysis and interpretation for decision making advices and hence tailored made treatment protocols for both individual cow that experience fertility problems and/or fertility related diseases as well as on herd level following the Dutch guidelines for intervention protocols, learning the underlying reasoning and background of the treatments including success rates. Keywords like sustainability, circularity, animal health and welfare but also the role of genomic selection on breeding programs will be interactively discussed during the course lectures in view of discussion on the global environment and protection related to future dairy farming.

## Learning goals

1.  The student reviews reproductive physiology and gains knowledge about the primary processes of Reproductive Management (clinical diagnostics: cyclicity, anestrus, pregnancy diagnostics (including ultrasonography) on dairy farms.¬†

<!-- -->

2.  The student can describe the etiopathogenesis of peripartum (negative energy balance/metabolic stress related) diseases affecting the reproductive function such as retention secundinarum and (sub-)clinical(endo-)metritis.¬†

<!-- -->

3.  The student learns about the interactions between the etiopathogenesis of peripartum metabolic stress and reproductive performance, such as delayed resumption of the ovarian cyclicity and anestrus.¬†

<!-- -->

4.  The student is able to analyze data from sensors and management programs to evaluate reproductive parameters of a dairy farm (calving interval, insemination number, interval calving-first heat and conception, etc.) to give tailored advice to the farmer.¬†

<!-- -->

5.  The student learns about the outline of the Dutch Guidelines for Reproductive Management of dairy farms, including the (patho-) physiological background and the fundaments of reproductive hormonal interventions both at the individual and herd level.¬†

<!-- -->

6.  The student can identify tools for improving the genetic merit of dairy cows, such as assisted reproductive technologies and genomic selection, to discern how and when these tools could be applied including breeding policy on farm.¬†

Since 2020 she is heading the reproduction laboratory of Farm Animal Health. With the reproduction team of enthusiastic researchers, technicians and students she tries to unravel the mysteries of early life. Her research focus is how to maintain a healthy condition for both mother and offspring.                                                                                                    |

My research has focused on applying transcriptomics and epigenomics to understand endometrial biology and embryonic and fetal development in ruminants. My philosophy for analysing and interpreting this data type is to use traditional and innovative approaches, such as predictive models based on machine learning algorithms, and adapt these methods to generate meaningful results in the biological context of the experiment. |
